Ticket
--------

Background
- We have been asked to write a programme that 
helps calculate the amount of fuel needed to
transport Santa. It will take in the mass of a 
module and calculate how much fuel is needed.

Notes
- The calculation used is mass/3 rounded down - 2.
All of these modules are then added together to 
calculate the total amount of fuel needed.

Acceptance Criteria
- Print the total amount of fuel:
```
$ python calculate_fuel.py module_masses.txt
123456.0
```


Game plan
------

1. Set up a test/change/fix cycle
  - empty unit test
  - create the required files we're going 
  - write a simple unit test that invokes a function from elves.py
  - have a command that runs the test
2. implement:
  - load the masses from the text file
  - take each mass and apply the calculation
  - add the outputs to calculate the total amount of fuel
  - output the answer
